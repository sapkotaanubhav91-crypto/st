## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark grey (#121212) for a sleek and modern feel. This color anchors off the visual style presented in the user-supplied screenshot, using dark mode to give an air of sophisticated modernism.
- Primary color: Electric purple (#BE29EC) to highlight interactive elements. The contrast from this eye-catching shade over the dark theme gives a vibrant aesthetic.
- Accent color: Lavender (#D096F3) for secondary interactive elements. This is used sparingly so as to not draw focus from the primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Simple, geometric icons to complement the modern design.
- Clean, scrollable chat window with clear distinction between user and AI messages.
- Typewriter effect for Anthara's responses, creating a natural conversational feel.
